	* src/main.c: Two minor fixes to allow it to work with newer 2.6.xx
	  kernels.  The first had to do with using a function call to get
	  the busses to iterate over, and the second has to do with not
	  setting a configuration.  Apartently this doesn't need to be done.

	* configure.ac: Incremented the release number
	* NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.0 release
	* src/commands.c: Removed the hardcoded restrictions on sizes and
	  instead malloc the space needed.  Additionally the size is gotten
	  from the arguments data structure, so that adding future devices
	  should be easier.
	* src/arguments.h: Added memory_size to the programmer_arguments
	  data structure.  Restructured the targets_enum so that it can
	  be used as keys into the target_map data structure for target
	  to name resolution without needing to duplicate data.
	* src/arguments.c: Made the changes needed to take advantage of the
	  memory size restructuring and changed the usage() function to
	  use iteration instead of duplication to display supported chips
