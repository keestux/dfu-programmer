	* dfu-programmer.spec.in: Update the supported chips
	* README: Added an instruction about building the source from CVS.

2006-06-19 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

	* AUTHORS: Updated David Brownell's contributions - which makes
	  up almost this entire check-in!
	* configure.ac: Incremented the release number
	* NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.3.0 release
	* src/arguments.c: Added the new targets, made the target names
	  case insensitive, added a version command line "command", updated
	  the mechanism for matching commands, and updated debugging output.
	* src/arguments.h: Added new targets, and cleaned the arguments
	  structure up a bit.
	* src/atmel.c: Applied general cleanup, matched the atmel.h
	  interfaces and added an AVR a configuration reading function.
	* src/atmel.h: Updated the interface to allow for 8051 vs AVR
	  differences.  This also starts the use of stdint.h values.
	* src/commands.c: Updated to a more standard debugging system and
	  added command checking for 8051 vs AVR differences.  There is
	  an open question about why we switch between args.memory_size
	  and args.memory_size+1 in comparisons.  I need to re-read up
	  on why in the world I did args.memory_size+1 in the first
	  place, then follow up with David about implications around
	  the AVR chips.
	* src/dfu.c: Updated to a more standard debugging system and
	  removed an overly verbose debug message.
	* src/intel_hex.c: Added comments about the record types, and
	  added 20 bit address types for the larger amount of addressable
	  flash memory.
	* src/main.c: Updated to a more standard debugging system,
	  updated the failure messages to include the package information.
	* README: Updated description and list of supported chips

	* AUTHORS: Added David Brownell as a contributor.
	* configure: Removed because it is generated by bootstrap.sh
	* Makefile.in: Removed because it is generated
	* docs/Makefile.in: Removed because it is generated
	* src/Makefile.in: Removed because it is generated
	* src/Makefile.am: Applied David Brownell's patch that adds -Wall
	  as a compiler option.

	* AUTHORS: Updated my email address
	* configure.ac: Incremented the release number
	* dfu-programmer.spec.in: Update the release to Fedora Core 5
	* NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.2 release
	* src/main.c: Fix the failure cases so that if the USB interface was
	  not acquired then it is not errantly released.

2005-11-21 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

	* configure.ac: Incremented the release number
	* NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.1 release

2005-11-21 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

	* docs/dfu-programmer.1: Bring the man page inline with the
	  built in help, plus a bit more info.

2005-11-21 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT alumni.purdue.edu>

	* src/main.c: Two minor fixes to allow it to work with newer 2.6.xx
	  kernels.  The first had to do with using a function call to get
	  the busses to iterate over, and the second has to do with not
	  setting a configuration.  Apartently this doesn't need to be done.

	* configure.ac: Incremented the release number
	* NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.0 release
	* src/commands.c: Removed the hardcoded restrictions on sizes and
	  instead malloc the space needed.  Additionally the size is gotten
	  from the arguments data structure, so that adding future devices
	  should be easier.
	* src/arguments.h: Added memory_size to the programmer_arguments
	  data structure.  Restructured the targets_enum so that it can
	  be used as keys into the target_map data structure for target
	  to name resolution without needing to duplicate data.
	* src/arguments.c: Made the changes needed to take advantage of the
	  memory size restructuring and changed the usage() function to
	  use iteration instead of duplication to display supported chips

	* src/{*.c,*.h}, AUTHORS: removed the copyright information from the
	  file so that the AUTHORS file can manage this information for the
	  entire project

2005-09-24 Weston Schmidt <weston_schmidt AT yahoo.com>

	* src/{arguments.c,arguments.h,atmel.c,commands.c}: applied
	  Reinhard Arlt's patch that adds support for the at89c5131 chip
