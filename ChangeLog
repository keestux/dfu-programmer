	* configure.ac: Incremented the release number
	* NEWS: Updated the latest news about the 0.2.0 release
	* src/commands.c: Removed the hardcoded restrictions on sizes and
	  instead malloc the space needed.  Additionally the size is gotten
	  from the arguments data structure, so that adding future devices
	  should be easier.
	* src/arguments.h: Added memory_size to the programmer_arguments
	  data structure.  Restructured the targets_enum so that it can
	  be used as keys into the target_map data structure for target
	  to name resolution without needing to duplicate data.
	* src/arguments.c: Made the changes needed to take advantage of the
	  memory size restructuring and changed the usage() function to
	  use iteration instead of duplication to display supported chips

	  file so that the AUTHORS file can manage this information for the
