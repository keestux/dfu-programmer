dfu-programmer is an implementation of the Device Firmware Upgrade class
USB driver that enables firmware upgrades for various USB enabled (with the
correct bootloader) Atmel chips.  This program was created because the
Atmel program for flashing devices does not support flashing via USB on linux.

Check out the Atmel website for more information.  They are kind enough to
provide a generally correct document that I based my implementation on.
Additionally the flash program they provide is called FLIP.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % tar -xzf dfu-programmer-<version>.tar.gz    # unpack the sources
  % cd dfu-programmer                           # change to the toplevel
                                                # directory

  % ./configure                                 # regenerate configure and
                                                # run it

  % make                                        # build dfu-programmer
  [ Become root necessary ]
  % make install                                # install dfu-programmer

Building RPM Binary Packages
============================
This section is intended to make it easier for those people that wish to
build RPMs from the source included in this package, but aren't sure how.

1) Copy dfu-programmer-<version>.tar.gz to your RPM SOURCES directory. Usually
   this is /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/.

2) Extract or copy dfu-programmer.spec into your RPM SPECS directory. Usually
   this is /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/.

3) In your RPM SPECS directory, issue the command 'rpm -ba dfu-programmer.spec'.
   This will cause rpm to extract the dfu-programmer sources to a temporary
   directory, build them, and build rpm packages based on the information in
   the spec file. The binary rpms will be put into your RPM RPMS directory.
   Usually this is /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<platform>/.

If you have any further questions, please refer to the RPM documentation.
